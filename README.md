What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
○ I chode mongodb which is a nosql database because its very easy to use and at the same time very powerful,it is also very much trending.So,i used it and liked it because unlike sql databases i dont have to worry much about schema of the tables.Also,making the connection to the database ,putting and retriving the data was very much easy.


What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
○I found the whole project easy,from making connection to mongodb and creating and querying collections or making timed ajax calls or creating animation for the incoming data ,i found everything easy and fun.


What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
○I didn't find any part hard or challanging,although it took me some time to figure out how i wanted the animation to look like.


If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
My biggest
